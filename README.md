# Geany-Autoalign
A python plugin for the geany editor that automatically aligns your symbols.

The other day I found out this is actually against the style convention for python.

For example "=":

<pre><code>fooooo=1
bar=1</code></pre>

becomes

<pre><code>fooooo = 1
bar    = 1</code></pre>

without you typing all those spaces!

To install it, just copy the .py to <code> ~/.config/geany/plugins/ </code> .
